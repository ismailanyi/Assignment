### Project Overview
This project involves analyzing datasets to extract meaningful insights and build predictive models. We will cover various aspects of Data Science, including data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning.

### Objectives
- Understand the data science workflow.
- Gain hands-on experience with data analysis tools.
- Develop skills in statistical analysis and machine learning.

### Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** R
- **Libraries:** 
  - `tidyverse` for data manipulation and visualization
  - `ggplot2` for creating visualizations
  - `randomForest` for machine learning models
  - `corrplot` for correlation analysis

### Installation Instructions
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ismailanyi/Assignment.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Assignment
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("tidyverse", "randomForest", "corrplot", "dplyr"))
   ```

### Data Analysis
The project includes various scripts for data analysis, including:
- **Data Loading:** Loading datasets and performing initial checks.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and duplicates.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Analyzing relationships between variables.

### Visualizations
Visualizations are created using `ggplot2` to illustrate key findings, including:
- Average sales volume by region.
- Trends in used BMW prices across regions.
- Correlation heatmaps.
